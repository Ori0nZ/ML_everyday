SwiftUI is so amazing!

If you missed my last email,
 SwiftUI is a new framework Apple unveiled
  where we can easily build user interfaces with Swift code.

Maybe it's all the hype, maybe I'm just excited that I
 can start teaching programmatic UI to beginners, maybe
  i'm just delirious from staying up all night digging into SwiftUI...

Either way, I think this is going to be game changing 
to the way we build user interfaces for apps. That's why 
I want to get ahead of it and start creating tutorials for it.

Here's the first video in a series of tutorials on SwiftUI:
